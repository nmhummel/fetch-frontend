# ABOUT
Welcome to my version of the Frontend Assessment for Fetch Rewards. I was tasked with building a simple form that included the following input fields:
- name
- email
- password
- occupation
- state

Occupation and state were provided as a JSON file, pulled from the endpoint link provided. Submissions were posted to the same link. Since the version of State (abbreviation vs. full spelling) was not specified with regards to displaying or posting, I opted to display both but post the full spelling.

I built this project using React's `create-react-app`.\
In lieu of the included Jest library, I opted to use Playwright for my testing needs. I had recently started to learn Playwright as part of my current job and wanted to practice. I had planned to do more with the testing, but was eager to submit.

I also used Tailwind for most of my styling with CSS files as well. I use Tailwind is my current job as well and enjoy learning it.

### To get started
Clone my repository on your local machine. You will need to have Node installed. After cloning, run command `npm install` to get all dependencies. 


In the project directory terminal, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. If the browser doesn't open automatically for any reason, you can copy and paste the follwoing link in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

I left in some select console logs for you to see some of the behind the scenes fun. I also recommend altering the `baseURL` to see the resulting errors. The page will automatically reload when you make any changes to the code. I opted to dismiss eslint errors.

### `CTRL+C`
This will end your local session.

### `npx playwright test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive popup in yur default browser. 
You will need to end any running sessions to perform this.



P.S. The footer image taken from the Fetch website is just for show, but click it for a fun Easter egg.
